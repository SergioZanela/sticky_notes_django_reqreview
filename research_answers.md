1. Conduct research to understand how HTTP applications preserve the state of an application across multiple request-response cycles, especially concerning user authentication and session management. Write a paragraph (150–250 words) describing your findings.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that every request sent from a browser to a server is treated as a completely new request. The server does not automatically remember previous actions. To solve this problem, web applications use sessions and cookies to preserve state. When a user logs in, the server creates a session and stores information about that user on the server side. The server then sends a session ID back to the browser as a cookie. On future requests, the browser automatically sends this cookie back to the server. This allows the server to identify the user and keep them logged in. In Django, this process is handled by the built-in authentication and session system. Django stores session data in the database by default and links it to a secure session ID stored in the browser. This makes it possible for applications to maintain login status and user-specific data across multiple pages and requests.

2. Investigate and document the procedures for performing Django database migrations to a server-based relational database like MariaDB. Write a paragraph (150–250 words) describing your findings.

Django uses migrations to manage changes to the database structure in an organized way. When a developer creates or updates a model, they run the command python manage.py makemigrations. This creates a migration file that contains instructions for the database changes. After that, the command python manage.py migrate is used to apply those changes to the database. When using a server-based database like MariaDB, Django connects to it using the MySQL database engine, since MariaDB is compatible with MySQL. The database connection settings must be configured in the DATABASES section inside settings.py, including the database name, user, password, host, and port. Once the connection is set up, running the migrate command will apply all migration files to the MariaDB server. This system ensures that the database structure stays consistent across development and production environments.
